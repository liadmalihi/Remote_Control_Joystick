# Remote_Control_JoyStick - Android App

This is an app which connects to the external software named FlightGear simulator.
The app controls the flight of an airplane from the simulator.

*Collaborators*:

The program was developed by four computer science students at Bar Ilan University, Israel - Liad Malihi and Yeheli Frangi.

*General Description*:

The program connects to the [flight simulator](https://www.flightgear.org/) as a client, and control the airplane values and ×›lies the plane according to values,
such as: Throttle, Elevator, Aileron and Rudder
The program connects to the simulator with ip and port.

*Code Degins*:

The FlightInseptionApp programmed with the MVVM design using data binding of the Kotlin language, and xml.
You can see the division between the view ,the viewModel and the model of the whole program.

*Features*:
* Slider-Throttle:
